**ID:** P3  
**Type:** Paper  
**Status:** Preprint (primary)

## PDF

## Role in the architecture
Bridge: Holding Equation + Tropic Info ⇒ Thermodynamic Tropic Filter (THF) and structural right-to-refusal.

## Suggested combinations
- Combine with **P1** (Tropic Information Theory) to derive the Thermodynamic Tropic Filter; combine with **N01** for the Holding Equation grounding.
