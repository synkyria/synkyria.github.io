title: Synkyrian Geometric Morphogenesis
---

**ID:** P2  
**Type:** Paper  
**Status:** Preprint (primary)

## PDF
- [Open PDF](/access/)

## Role in the architecture
Core synthesis: P→L→F assimilation; geometric hazard landscapes; thresholds/windows.

## Suggested combinations
- Combine with **P1** for micro→geometry mapping; combine with **P5** for network morphogenesis (multi-kernel assimilation).
