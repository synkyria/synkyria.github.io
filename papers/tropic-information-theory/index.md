title: Tropic Information Theory
---

**ID:** P1  
**Type:** Paper  
**Status:** Preprint (primary)

## Abstract (short)
P1 develops the micro-layer of Synkyria: **information is not free** under finite horizons.
Incoming information consumes capacity and thermodynamic resources, so filtering becomes a structural requirement.
The paper formalises “morphogenetic value under load” and derives threshold-style admissibility rules.

## What it establishes
- A **tropic micro-law**: keep only what remains compatible with finite-horizon viability.
- A filtering theorem that turns “refusal” from advice into a constraint-driven consequence.
- The bridge from P0’s spine language to operational selection rules.

## Suggested combinations
- Read with **P0** for the spine constraint it preserves.
- Continue to **P3** for the thermodynamic right-to-refusal embedding.
