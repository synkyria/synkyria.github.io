## Status

**Translation paper**  
This text does not introduce new proofs.  
It translates the structural consequences of the Synkyria technical corpus into a
controlled phenomenological vocabulary.

## Verification backbone

All proof-bearing statements are anchored in the
[Post–Stability Technical Corpus](../../corpus/post-stability/).

## Abstract

A viability-first account of the self as maintained admissibility of contact under load,
distinguishing self from identity and refusal from withdrawal, while preserving Gestalt’s
phenomenology of contact.
