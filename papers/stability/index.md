title: Synkyrian Stability as an Architectural Framework
---

**ID:** P0  
**Type:** Paper  
**Status:** Zenodo (frozen)

## What it establishes (in one paragraph)
P0 defines the canonical viability language of Synkyria: **finite-horizon survival** under load and hazard.
It formalises holding as a horizon-indexed surrogate of failure probability and uses this to translate
“stability” into an architectural constraint: what can remain admissible before collapse.

## Key outputs
- A horizon-first notion of **viability** (fail-before-T vs. asymptotic claims).
- A canonical **holding / hazard** framing that other papers treat as the spine variable.
- A design stance: viability constraints come **before** optimisation.
