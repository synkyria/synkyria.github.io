## PDF
- [Open PDF](/assets/pdfs/Synkyrian_Stability_as_an_Architectural_Framework.pdf)

## Role in the architecture
Canonical spine (finite-horizon viability; holding index H_rig; log-hazard; bridges to KSP/MEPP/network bottlenecks).

## Suggested combinations
- Backbone: cite alongside **N01–N04** for thermodynamic + kernel grounding, and **N12/N20** for canonicity + bottlenecks.
