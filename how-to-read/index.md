title: How to read
---

Synkyria is not a single paper or a closed theory.
It is a **framework for reasoning about viability under constraint**.

If you are new, do **not** try to read everything.
Use the paths below.

---

## 1. What problem does Synkyria address?

Most theories optimise for:

- equilibrium
- efficiency
- convergence
- growth

Synkyria asks a different question:

**Can a field remain viable under finite resources, load, and time?**

Across therapy, organisations, ecosystems, and technical systems,
Synkyria treats each as a *field*:
a finite structure that must hold under load, hazard, and time.

This shift—from equilibrium to **finite-horizon viability**—
is the core idea of Synkyria.

---

## 2. Start with the Spine (one paper)

### Synkyrian Stability as an Architectural Framework  
→ `/papers/stability/`

This paper defines:
- *holding* (how much strain a system can absorb)
- *hazard* (how failure accumulates)
- *viability horizon* (how long survival is possible)

You do **not** need all the math on first read.
Focus on:
- definitions
- diagrams
- interpretation sections

Everything else builds around this.


## Interlude: Reading at the Human Scale (SFV)

Not all readers will want—or need—to begin from formal mathematics.

For those interested in how viability constraints are *lived* rather than formalised,
Synkyria develops a parallel but autonomous series:

### Structural Phenomenology of Viability (SFV)

SFV translates finite-horizon constraints into human-scale intelligibility:
silence, hesitation, ambiguity, refusal, and restraint
as lawful structural operations rather than psychological deficits.

It does **not** apply mathematics to experience,
nor does it derive phenomenology from formal models.
Instead, it articulates the *same constraint* at a different scale.

→ Explore the series at **[Structural Phenomenology of Viability (SFV)](/sfv/)**

Readers may engage SFV independently,
or return to the formal corpus after orientation.

## 3. Understand why information must be filtered

### Tropic Information Theory  
→ `/papers/tropic-information-theory/`

Key idea:
> Not all information should be processed.

Information carries **load** and **morphogenetic pressure**, not just content.
Filtering is therefore structural, not optional.

Read this if you want to understand *why refusal exists at all*.

---

## 4. See how form emerges (and why it must be delayed)

### Synkyrian Geometric Morphogenesis  
→ `/papers/geometric-morphogenesis/`

This introduces the core chain:

> **P → L → F**  
> Profile → Load → Form

Form appears only **after**:
- filtering
- delay
- viability checks

This explains why premature structure causes collapse.

---

## 5. Refusal is not ethical — it is physical

### The Thermodynamic Right to Refusal  
→ `/papers/right-to-refusal/`

Here refusal is shown to be:
- required by the Second Law
- a consequence of finite negentropy
- a *structural necessity*

This paper reframes “saying no” as a **lawful operation**, not a value judgement.

---

## 6. Scaling up: from systems to networks

### Synkyrian Networked Fields  
→ `/papers/networked-fields/`

This paper shows:
- how local overload becomes global failure
- why bottlenecks dominate network survival
- how viability is constrained by structure, not intent

Follow with:

### Network Diagnostics  
→ `/notes/network-diagnostics/`

This gives measurable indicators that make the theory operational.

---

## 7. From theory to governance

### Synkyrian Network Policies  
→ `/papers/network-policies/`

Here policies are treated as **structural choices**, not moral positions:
- repair vs firewall
- rotation vs sacrifice

### Synkyrian Network Charter  
→ `/charter/network/`

This translates theory into a constitutional layer.

---

## 8. Technical and companion tracks (optional)

If you are interested in implementation:

- **Holding Canonical Spec** → `/tech/holding-spec/`
- **CFE Companion Pack** → `/tech/cfe-pack-v0.2/`
- **Training Companion (Demo)** → `/repro/training-companion-v1/`

These show how Synkyria can be embedded in real systems.

---

## Minimal reading paths

### 15-minute orientation
- Stability (overview sections)
- Architecture Map  
→ `/architecture/`

### Theory-focused
- Stability → Tropic Information → Geometric Morphogenesis → Right to Refusal

### Governance-focused
- Stability → Networked Fields → Diagnostics → Network Policies → Charter

### Technical
- Stability → Holding Spec → Companion Pack → Demo

---

## Final note

Synkyria is not meant to be consumed linearly.

It is meant to be **entered**, **tested**, and **combined**.

If you are unsure where to go next:

- Start from the **[Architecture Map](/theory/)** to understand how the system fits together.
- Or browse the **[Library](/library/)** to explore individual papers and notes.


and follow the connections.
