title: How to Read
---

Synkyria is not a single paper or a closed theory.
It is a **framework for reasoning about viability under constraint**.

If you are new, do **not** try to read everything.
Use one of the paths below.

---

## 1. What problem does Synkyria address?

Most theories optimise for:

- equilibrium
- efficiency
- convergence
- growth

Synkyria asks a different question:

**Can a field remain viable under finite resources, load, and time?**

Across therapy, organisations, ecosystems, and technical systems,
Synkyria treats each as a *field*:
a finite structure that must hold under load, hazard, and time.

This shift—from equilibrium to **finite-horizon viability**—
is the core idea of Synkyria.

## 2. Choose your entry point (two legitimate ways in)

You can enter Synkyria from the reader-facing series **or** from the formal spine.
Neither is “more correct”. They speak at different levels.

### A) Human-scale entry (recommended for most readers)
Start with:

- **[SFV — Structural Phenomenology of Viability](/sfv/)**  
  Viability constraints made intelligible at the human scale:
  silence, hesitation, ambiguity, refusal, restraint
  as lawful operations rather than deficits.

Then use:

- **[RSN — Reader–Stabilizer Notes](/rsn/)**  
  Short notes designed to prevent predictable misreadings
  (e.g. “non-change = conservatism”, “growth must be pursued”, “refusal = pathology”).

You can remain entirely within SFV/RSN
and still understand the Synkyrian constraint clearly.

### B) Formal spine (for theory-first readers)
If you prefer a single anchor paper:

**Synkyrian Stability as an Architectural Framework**  
→ `/papers/stability/`

You do **not** need all the math on first read.
Focus on:
- definitions
- diagrams
- interpretation sections

Everything else references this spine.

---

## 3. The core theoretical chain (optional depth)

If you want the internal logic that supports SFV/RSN:

### Tropic Information Theory  
→ `/papers/tropic-information-theory/`

Key idea:
> Not all information should be processed.

Information carries **load** and **morphogenetic pressure**, not just content.

---

### Synkyrian Geometric Morphogenesis  
→ `/papers/geometric-morphogenesis/`

Core chain:

> **P → L → F**  
> Profile → Load → Form

Form appears only **after** filtering, delay, and viability checks.

---

### The Thermodynamic Right to Refusal  
→ `/papers/right-to-refusal/`

Refusal is reframed as:
- a Second-Law consequence,
- a finite negentropy constraint,
- a structural necessity.

---

## 4. Scaling up: from systems to networks

### Synkyrian Networked Fields  
→ `/papers/networked-fields/`

How local overload becomes global failure;
why bottlenecks dominate network survival.

Follow with:

### Synkyrian Network Policies  
→ `/papers/network-policies/`

Policies as **structural choices**, not moral postures.

---

## 5. Governance layer (when the framework becomes constitutional)

### Synkyrian Network Charter  
→ `/charter/network/`

A constitutional articulation of viability constraints
for multi-field coordination.

---

## 6. Technical & companion tracks (optional)

If you are interested in implementation, start from the Library’s technical section:
→ **[Library](/library/)**

(Technical artifacts may be selectively public, depending on the release policy.)

---

## Minimal reading paths

### 15-minute orientation
- SFV overview
- RSN-01
- then browse the Library for one spine paper

### Reader-first (most people)
- SFV → RSN → return to Stability (interpretation sections)

### Theory-first
- Stability → Tropic Information → Geometric Morphogenesis → Right to Refusal

### Governance-first
- Networked Fields → Network Policies → Charter

---

## Final note

Synkyria is not meant to be consumed linearly.

It is meant to be **entered**, **tested**, and **combined**.

If you are unsure where to go next:
- browse the **[Library](/library/)**,
- or start from **SFV** and let RSN prevent the common misreads.
