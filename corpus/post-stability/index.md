## What this is

This document is the **canonical technical backbone** of the Synkyria project.

It is **not a paper** and **not an interpretive text**.

It serves as:
- a verification ledger,
- a routing map for proof-bearing documents,
- and a reference spine for all viability-based claims made elsewhere in the project.

## Scope

The corpus contains:
- definitions and canonical objects (e.g. finite-horizon risk, collapse horizons),
- structural relations between stability, holding, morphogenesis, and networks,
- and explicit pointers to where proofs and technical constructions live.

It does **not**:
- introduce phenomenological interpretation,
- propose clinical language,
- or offer philosophical commentary.

## How it is used

All translation papers (e.g. *The Self Before Contact*) cite this corpus as their
**verification layer**, but do not reproduce its contents.

## External translation papers (non-canonical)

The following texts provide phenomenological or interpretive translations
of the technical corpus. They do not introduce new definitions or proofs
and are not part of the numbered canonical record.
