## What this is

The Post–Stability Technical Corpus is the **canonical verification backbone** of Synkyria.

It is **not a reader text** and **not a paper**.
It functions as:

- a **ledger** of proof-bearing documents (IDs, status, placement),
- a **routing map** for what supports what (spine → micro → geometry → refusal → networks → policy),
- a **reference spine** for every viability-based claim made elsewhere on this site.

**PDFs are not hosted publicly.**  
Access is provided *upon request* for review and citation verification.

## How to read the technical architecture (in one pass)

If you want a clean route:

1) **P0 — Stability (spine):** holding / hazard / finite-horizon viability  
2) **P1 — Tropic Information Theory (micro-law):** information-as-load → filtering theorem  
3) **P2 — Geometric Morphogenesis:** hazard landscapes; threshold windows; P→L→F assimilation  
4) **P3 — Thermodynamic Right to Refusal:** refusal as structural consequence (HE + Tropic Info)  
5) **P4 — Invariant-Preserving Filtering:** refusal beyond binary; keep invariants under load  
6) **P5 — Networked Fields:** bottlenecks dominate; network viability constraints  
7) **P6 — Network Policies:** viability firewall; no-sacrifice / governance layer  
8) **C1 — Network Charter:** constitution layer grounded in diagnostics + theorems

## External translation papers (non-canonical)

These texts translate the technical consequences into controlled phenomenological vocabulary.
They do not add new definitions or proofs.
