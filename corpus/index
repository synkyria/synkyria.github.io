Synkyria has two layers:

1) **Public translation layer** (SFV / RSN): reader-first texts that translate the viability spine into lived intelligibility.  
2) **Technical backbone** (post-stability corpus): proof-bearing documents, diagnostics, and canonical placement.

The technical PDFs are **not hosted publicly**. They are available **upon request** for research review, verification, and controlled citation.

## Technical backbone
- **Post–Stability Technical Corpus (canonical ledger):** [/corpus/post-stability/](/corpus/post-stability/)

## Access
- **Request access to full PDFs:** [/access/](/access/)
