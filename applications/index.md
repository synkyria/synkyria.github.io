The following applications operationalise the Synkyrian framework as
**functional companions**, translating finite-horizon stability concepts
into practical diagnostic tools.

### Synkyria Monitor — Core  
**Finite-Horizon Stability Dashboard**

Synkyria Monitor is an applied stability dashboard inspired by the
Synkyrian holding framework. It operationalises finite-horizon viability
and structural stability through a minimal, transparent set of
diagnostic indices.

Conceptually, the system is grounded in the rigorous finite-horizon
holding quantity

$$ H_{\mathrm{rig}}(x;T) = -\frac{1}{T}\log q_T(x) $$

which captures the probability of sustained viability over a finite
temporal horizon. The Monitor translates this theoretical notion into
practical diagnostics suitable for experimentation, simulation, and
system observation.

### Synkyrian Training Companion  
**Minimal Training-Time Stability Companion**

The Synkyrian Training Companion is a lightweight experimental tool
designed to observe Synkyrian stability dynamics during learning and
training processes. It focuses on how load, holding, and morphogenetic
pressure evolve across finite horizons under active adaptation.

Rather than optimising performance, the companion foregrounds
**structural viability** and stability signals, making it suitable for
exploratory research and conceptual testing.
