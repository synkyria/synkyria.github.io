A reader-first library of the Synkyria corpus.

## What this page is (and is not)

This page is a **library**: it privileges *readability and orientation* over exhaustive technical listing.

- **First**: the translational lines (**SFV** and **RSN**) — where the framework becomes legible without requiring formal machinery.
- **Then**: the technical backbone — the formal spine that these translations are derived from.
- **Finally**: a complete internal ledger (appendix) for canonical placement and IDs.

If you are looking for the full ledger immediately, jump to: **[Appendix — Full Corpus Ledger](#appendix--full-corpus-ledger)**.

## Start here (three reading paths)

### 1) Clinicians / therapists / field practitioners
- **[SFV — Series overview](/sfv/)** (start here)
- SFV-01 *The Self Before Contact*
- SFV-03 *The Embodied Viability Protocol (Tropic Body)*
- SFV-04 *Ambiguity as Structural Law*

### 2) Mathematicians / formal readers
- **[FOP — Fractal Onto-Praxis](/fractal-onto-praxis/)** (field-first architecture)
- P0 *Synkyrian Stability as an Architectural Framework* (spine)
- N01 *The Holding Equation* + N02 *Thermodynamic Right to Refusal*
- N12 *Kernel Stability Principle* (KSP)

### 3) AI builders / companion design
- K30 *CFE Companion Pack* (hooks / interface layer)
- S20 *Holding Canonical Spec*
- N40 *Network Diagnosis* (if working at system scale)

## Translational lines (Layer 2)

### SFV — Structural Phenomenology of Viability
SFV translates viability constraints into **lived field-signatures** (capacity, refusal, contact-cost, kairos) without introducing new formal machinery.

- **Series index:** **[/sfv/](/sfv/)**
- Canonical texts: SFV-01, SFV-02, SFV-03, SFV-04 (see the SFV page for descriptions and access links).

### RSN — Reader-Stabilizer Notes
RSN texts are **stabilising meta-articles** written to prevent predictable misreadings of SFV: “is this conservatism?”, “why not self-improvement?”, “what about external pressures?”, etc.

- **Series index:** `/rsn/` *(to be added; requests are routed via /access/ for now)*
- Example: RSN-01 *Change Without Coercion* (meta-clarification).

---

## Technical backbone (Layer 0) — shown without full exposure
The technical corpus is the **formal spine** (equations, indices, bounds, thresholds).  
Public pages may reference it by **ID** and *role in the architecture*; access to full artifacts is managed via **/access/**.

If you only need a minimal anchor set, start with: P0, N01, N02, N12, N20.
