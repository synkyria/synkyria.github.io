## Quick synthesis recipes

- **Stability spine:** P0 + (N01–N04) + (N12 canonicity lemma) + (N20 Cheeger/bottlenecks).
- **Refusal as physics:** N01 + P1 ⇒ P3 (Thermodynamic Right to Refusal). Then P4 to move beyond binary deletion (distributed gating).
- **Morphogenesis pipeline:** P1 + P2 + P4 (from micro profiles → geometry → maturation/invariants).
- **Network governance:** P5 + N40 + P6 ⇒ C1 (diagnostics + policy regimes ⇒ charter clauses).
- **Companion implementation track:** S20 + K30 + R40 + K60 (contract + hooks + demo + architecture).
