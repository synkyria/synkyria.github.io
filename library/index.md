A reader-first library of the Synkyria corpus.

> This public site does **not** host full technical PDFs.  
> It hosts **reading pages** (orientation, abstracts, roles, indices).  
> Full technical artifacts are available via **[Request access](/access/)**.

## What this library is

Synkyria is not a “set of papers”.  
It is an **architecture** with a technical spine and two public translational lines.

- **SFV** (Structural Phenomenology of Viability): viability translated into lived field-signatures.
- **RSN** (Reader–Stabilizer Notes): meta-notes that prevent predictable misreadings of SFV.
- **Technical spine**: the formal constraints SFV/RSN are *derived from*.

If you want the full internal ledger (IDs, placement, governance), go to:
**[Corpus Catalogue](/catalogue/)**.

## Start here (choose a path)

### For therapists / clinicians / practitioners
Start with **SFV**, then use **RSN** when readers “push back”.

### For mathematicians / formal readers
Start with **the technical spine overview**, then read SFV as a disciplined translation (not metaphor).

### For AI builders / companion design
Use SFV/RSN for “human-field integrity”, and the spine for constraints, indices, and hooks.

## SFV — Structural Phenomenology of Viability (Layer 2)

SFV translates finite-horizon viability into lived primitives
(capacity, refusal, contact-cost, kairos, trauma-as-load) **without introducing new machinery**.

| ID | Title | What it does | Status | Page |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SFV-01 | The Self Before Contact | Why “pre-contact” is structural, not psychological | Public page / Controlled artifact | **[/sfv/#sfv-01](/sfv/#sfv-01)** |
| SFV-02 | Finite-Horizon Discernment | Why “not changing” can be fidelity to viability | Public page / Controlled artifact | **[/sfv/#sfv-02](/sfv/#sfv-02)** |
| SFV-03 | Embodied Viability Protocol | How capacity/room becomes a regulated field signature | Public page / Controlled artifact | **[/sfv/#sfv-03](/sfv/#sfv-03)** |
| SFV-04 | Ambiguity as Structural Law | Why ambiguity is not a defect but a constraint regime | Public page / Controlled artifact | **[/sfv/#sfv-04](/sfv/#sfv-04)** |

## RSN — Reader–Stabilizer Notes (Layer 2)

RSN are short meta-articles that stabilise how SFV is read:
they answer predictable criticisms (“Is this conservatism?”, “Why not self-improvement?”,
“What about external pressures?”) **without drifting into coercive advice**.

| ID | Title | What it stabilises | Status | Page |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSN-01 | Change Without Coercion | “Non-change” ≠ conservatism; change arrives as residue | Public page / Controlled artifact | **[/rsn/#rsn-01](/rsn/#rsn-01)** |

> RSN pages are meant to be readable by everyone; artifacts remain controlled via **/access/**.

## Technical spine (Layer 0) — minimal public index

This is the formal backbone SFV/RSN are **derived from**.
Public pages cite the spine by role + DOI (when frozen on Zenodo).

| Node | Role in the architecture | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P0 — Synkyrian Stability | canonical finite-horizon viability spine | Zenodo (frozen) / controlled access |
| HE — Holding Equation | second-law consistent viability gauge | Zenodo (frozen) / controlled access |
| KSP — Kernel Stability Principle | kernel-level admissibility and bottlenecks | preprint / controlled access |
| HVF series | deeper derivations / bounds / regimes | preprints / controlled access |

For the full spine ledger (all Nxx items), go to **[Corpus Catalogue](/catalogue/)**.

## Where the “frozen” Zenodo works appear

If a work is frozen on Zenodo, the public page will include:
- citation,
- DOI,
- and a short “role in architecture” paragraph.

The full corpus is **not** exposed as a file server.
This library is a **navigation surface**, not an asset dump.
