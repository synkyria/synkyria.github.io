A reader-first library of the Synkyria corpus.

**SFV and RSN are public.**  
The technical corpus is referenced (role/citation), but its PDFs are not hosted here.

## Start here

### SFV — Structural Phenomenology of Viability (public)
SFV translates finite-horizon viability into lived intelligibility (capacity, refusal, contact-cost, kairos)
without adding new formal machinery.

- **SFV series page:** **[/sfv/](/sfv/)**

Quick entry points:
- **SFV-01** — The Self Before Contact: **[/sfv/#the-self-before-contact](/sfv/#the-self-before-contact)**
- **SFV-02** — Finite-Horizon Discernment: **[/sfv/#finite-horizon-discernment-before-contact](/sfv/#finite-horizon-discernment-before-contact)**
- **SFV-03** — Embodied Viability Protocol: **[/sfv/#the-embodied-viability-protocol-tropic-body](/sfv/#the-embodied-viability-protocol-tropic-body)**
- **SFV-04** — Ambiguity as Structural Law: **[/sfv/#ambiguity-as-structural-law](/sfv/#ambiguity-as-structural-law)**

### RSN — Reader–Stabilizer Notes (public)
RSN are short stabilising notes that prevent predictable misreadings of SFV
(“non-change = conservatism?”, “why not self-improvement?”, “external pressures as load?”).

- **RSN series page:** **[/rsn/](/rsn/)**

## Technical spine (referenced, not hosted)
Synkyria’s technical work provides the formal constraints SFV/RSN are derived from.
This site provides role descriptions and citations; PDFs are not hosted publicly.
