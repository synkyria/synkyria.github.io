## About this project

Synkyria is a long-term research and design programme.
Beyond its formal papers, technical corpora, and Zenodo-archived releases,
the project also includes contextual and programmatic texts that explain
**how** and **why** this work has taken the form it has.

> **Important note**  
> The texts collected in this section are **not part of the canonical
> Synkyrian corpus**.
> They provide **contextual, methodological, and programmatic framing**
> for the work, not formal theory or technical validation.
