This page indexes the **non-corpus texts** of the Synkyria programme:
Auras, public-facing writings, and external publications that translate
or emerge from the theory without constituting its formal mathematical backbone.

> **Authoritative theoretical and technical records live on Zenodo.**  
> This site functions as a navigational and contextual layer.
