## Aura Series

- **Aura 000 – The Science That Holds**  
  Introduces Synkyria in phenomenological language: how science changes when it starts from finite capacity instead of idealised observers.  
  *(Zenodo link to be added.)*

- **Aura 007 – Ambiguity & Threshold**  
  On staying with ambiguity, crossing thresholds, and why not-knowing is part of holding.  
  *(Zenodo link to be added.)*

- **Other Auras**  
  Additional Auras explore topics such as pedagogy, translation, gravity as holding, and the physics of suspension.  
  Links and summaries will be added as they are stabilised.
