# Tropic Lexicon – Key Concepts in Synkyria

A living glossary of the core terms used across Synkyria: theory, philosophy, and tools.

## Euryperos (Ευρύπερος)

**Short:** The *field of suspension* inside the Tropic Void Lattice (TVL).

A space where half-formed, refused or premature structures are held without being forced into form or erased. TVL is the space of possibility; Euryperos is the space of suspension – TVL with memory of what did not (yet) become.

## TVL – Tropic Void Lattice

A non-temporal, fractal substrate of possibility. TVL is not “nothing”; it is structured potential where many tropes and forms can co-inhabit without contradiction. Euryperos lives inside TVL as the region touched by intention but still unformed.

## Holding

The central Synkyrian notion: how long a field can safely sustain a given state under real hazards, at finite cost, with a right to refuse.

Mathematically, holding appears as a finite-horizon log-hazard functional \(H_{\mathrm{rig}}\); ethically, it governs how much load, risk and information we allow onto people, organisations and ecosystems.

---

## Refusal

A structural right of the field to drop tasks, discard information or slow down when capacity is at risk. In Synkyrian AI, refusal is a first-class decision, not an error.

---

## Morphogenesis

Form as assimilated history: what has survived enough hazard and cost to become structure. Synkyrian Geometric Morphogenesis reads crisis resonance, suspended cores and transformation windows as signatures of thresholds in this process.

---

## Tropic Companion

A conversational engine that applies Synkyrian indices (holding, overload, refusal signals) to dialogue. Its purpose is to protect the field, not to maximise engagement.
