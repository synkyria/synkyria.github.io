## The Synkyria Architecture (at a glance)

Synkyria is organised as an **architectural system**, not a linear theory.
Each layer answers a different question about **viability under constraint**,
and layers are designed to *compose*, not replace one another.

---

## 1. Canonical Spine — Viability as Architecture

**P0 — Synkyrian Stability as an Architectural Framework**  
→ `/papers/stability/`

This is the **spine** of the entire project.

- Replaces equilibrium with **finite-horizon viability**
- Introduces *holding* as an architectural quantity
- Provides the reference notions of:
  - viability horizon
  - hazard accumulation
  - structural bottlenecks

Everything else either:
- **feeds into** the spine (lemmas, constructions), or
- **extends outwards** (geometry, networks, policy, companions)

## 2. Bridge Layer — From Information to Form

These papers explain **how load becomes structure**.

### P1 — Tropic Information Theory  
→ `/papers/tropic-information-theory/`

- Micro-layer of information under load
- Information carries *morphogenetic value*, not just bits
- Establishes the **filter theorem**: not all information should pass

### P2 — Synkyrian Geometric Morphogenesis  
→ `/papers/geometric-morphogenesis/`

- Geometry of viability
- Introduces the **P → L → F** chain:
  - Profile → Load → Form
- Explains *why* form emerges only after filtering

### P3 — The Thermodynamic Right to Refusal  
→ `/papers/right-to-refusal/`

- Connects holding to the Second Law
- Shows that **refusal is structural**, not ethical
- Introduces the **Thermodynamic Tropic Filter (THF)**

### P4 — Invariant-Preserving Morphogenetic Filtering  
→ `/papers/invariant-morphogenetic-filtering/`

- Extends refusal beyond binary deletion
- Filtering that preserves invariants while allowing maturation
- Completion of the P → L → F pipeline

**Together:**  
> Information → Geometry → Filtering → Form  
> (without collapse)

## 3. Network Layer — From Systems to Fields

These works scale Synkyria from single systems to **networks and fields**.

### P5 — Synkyrian Networked Fields  
→ `/papers/networked-fields/`

- Multi-kernel viability
- Networked Cheeger-type bottlenecks
- Shows how *local holding* constrains *global survival*

### N40 — Network Diagnostics  
→ `/notes/network-diagnostics/`

- Operational diagnostics:
  - Dhaz (hazard density)
  - Lcol (load concentration)
  - SEI, Rsalv
- Turns theory into **measurable indicators**

### P6 — Synkyrian Network Policies  
→ `/papers/network-policies/`

- Policy regimes as structural choices
- Repair / rotation vs firewall strategies
- Introduces the **no-sacrifice principle** at network scale

---

## 4. Charter Layer — From Theory to Constitution

### C1 — Synkyrian Network Charter  
→ `/charter/network/`

- Public-facing constitutional layer
- Clauses grounded directly in:
  - theorems (from P0, P5)
  - diagnostics (from N40)
- Marks the transition:
  
> From ethics → to structural governance

---

## 5. Companion Track — From Architecture to Practice

This track translates Synkyria into **technical companions**.

### S20 — Holding Canonical Specification  
→ `/tech/holding-spec/`

- Formal contract for the holding quantity
- Ensures consistency across implementations

### K30 — CFE Companion Pack  
→ `/tech/cfe-pack-v0.2/`

- Hooks and interfaces for companions
- Bridges theory to executable systems

### R40 — Training Companion (Reproducible)  
→ `/repro/training-companion-v1/`

- Demonstration artifact
- Shows holding, refusal, and diagnostics *in action*

## Reading Paths (Suggested)

### For theory-first readers
1. P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 → P4  
2. Then P5 → N40 → P6 → C1

### For applied / governance readers
1. P0 → P5 → N40  
2. Then P6 → C1

### For technical / AI readers
1. P0 → S20  
2. Then K30 → R40

## Key Architectural Principle

> **Synkyria is not a single theory.**  
> It is a *viability architecture* in which:
> - information is filtered,
> - form is delayed,
> - refusal is structural,
> - and survival is finite-horizon.
