# Theoretical Core

The theoretical backbone of Synkyria is a **Synkyrian trilogy** plus a **network layer**, supported by a wider Tropic corpus.

## Synkyrian Trilogy

These three works form the core mathematical and conceptual architecture.

- **Synkyrian Stability as an Architectural Framework**  
  *Finite-horizon viability and hazard landscapes.*  
  Introduces the rigorous holding index \(H_{\mathrm{rig}}\), first-passage and spectral tools, and a shift from asymptotic equilibrium to “how long can this state be held?”.  
  *(Zenodo link to be added.)*

- **Tropic Information Theory – The Science That Holds**  
  *Information as weight, load, and refusal.*  
  Reinterprets information as burden on a finite-capacity field. Formalises the right to refuse, drop, or delay information as a structural requirement.  
  *(Zenodo link to be added.)*

- **Synkyrian Geometric Morphogenesis**  
  *Hazard landscapes and form as assimilated history.*  
  Assembles holding and information into a geometric description of form. Introduces crisis resonance (CRQ), suspended core persistence (SCP), and transformation windows (T) as tools for reading thresholds and reorganisation.  
  *(Zenodo link to be added.)*

## Synkyrian Networked Fields

- **Synkyrian Networked Fields: Multi-Kernel Viability and Governance**  
  Extends single-field Synkyria to **graphs of kernels**: tissues, ecosystems, socio-technical systems, AI pipelines.  
  Defines network holding exponents, a Synkyrian Cheeger-type bottleneck functional \(\Phi_{\mathrm{net}}\), and a shared-capacity picture where many kernels live on the same ground.  
  The note is intentionally a *programme*: it specifies the formal setting and points to applications in cancer, ecology, and AI governance.

## Extended Tropic Volumes

Beyond the trilogy and network note, several Tropic volumes and Auras provide deeper context:

- **Vol.14 – Tropic AI**  
  Theoretical backbone for Tropic Companions, Guardians, and monitoring tools. Connects Synkyrian indices with AI design and pedagogy.

- **Vol.18 / 18.1 – Eὐρύπερος**  
  On the unformed field and suspension as full form. Explores how holding without immediate manifestation can itself be pedagogical.

- **Vol.30 – Holding Before Form (Tropic Physics)**  
  Develops Tropic Physics and the TEE system of equations, linking holding, entropy, and open-systems dynamics.

- **Aura Series (e.g. Aura 000, Aura 007)**  
  Rhythmic, phenomenological texts that translate the theory into lived experience and pedagogy.

Links and summaries for each volume will be added as materials are finalised and made public.
