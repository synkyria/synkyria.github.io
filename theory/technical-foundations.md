title: Technical Foundations of Synkyria
---

This page collects the more technical notes and preprints that underpin the Synkyrian trilogy and the network framework. It is not exhaustive, but it gives readers a map of the core mathematical and physical constructions.

Where possible, links will point to Zenodo DOIs or public PDFs.

## 1 · Open-system viability and the Holding Equation

These works define and refine the **Holding Equation** as a gauge for open-system viability, consistent with the Second Law.

- **The Holding Equation: A Second-Law–Consistent Gauge for Open-System Viability**  

  [Page](/notes/canonical/holding-equation/) · [PDF](/access/)

  Introduces the viability gauge  
  \[
  H = \kappa\,\frac{\Phi_S - \sigma}{R(1 + \hat\rho)}
  \]
  linking free-energy surplus, entropy production, relaxation and congestion into a single open-system holding index.  
  

- **ΜΕΡΡ and MEPP-consistent Channels**  

  [Page](/notes/canonical/mepp/) · [PDF](/access/)

  Explores how maximum entropy production principles (MEPP) can be reconciled with explicit holding constraints, leading to MEPP-consistent channels that respect finite viability.

## 2 · Kernel Stability and canonical indices

These works extend holding to networks of states and define canonical Synkyrian indices.

- **The Kernel Stability Principle (KSP)**  

  [Page](/notes/canonical/ksp/) · [PDF](/access/)

  Extends single-node viability to kernel-level dynamics and shows how sustained overload on a kernel degrades both short-term viability growth and long-run attractors.  
  

- **From Variability to Holding: Canonical Synkyrian Indices and a Unified View of HE · KSP · MEPP**  

  [Page](/notes/canonical/variability-to-holding/) · [PDF](/access/)

  Clarifies the role of indices such as CRQ, SCP and T as downside- and tail-aware functionals built on the Holding Equation and Kernel Stability; unifies earlier “legacy” forms under a single Synkyrian architecture.

## 3 · Holding as a Viability Functional (series)

The *Holding as a Viability Functional* series makes the notion of holding as a functional on paths and environments mathematically precise.

- **Holding as a Viability Functional V – Synkyrian Surrogates and a Representation Theorem**  

  [Page](/notes/hvf-v/) · [PDF](/access/)

  Studies surrogate holding indices \(H_{\mathrm{syn}}\) and proves that, under a conservative viability bound and a calibration axiom against failure probabilities, \(H_{\mathrm{syn}}\) must be a monotone transform of the rigorous log-hazard functional \(H_{\mathrm{rig}}\).  
  

- **Holding as a Viability Functional – Environmental Left Tails and Long-Time Survival of Open Systems**  

  [Page](/notes/hvf-open/) · [PDF](/access/)

  Treats holding as a functional of the **left tail** of environmental decay rates and classifies long-time survival in terms of the behaviour of that distribution near zero.  
  

- **Holding as a Viability Functional X – A Variational Principle for Flow under Viability Constraints**  

  [Page](/notes/hvf-x/) · [PDF](/access/)

  Formulates a variational problem for flows (and entropy production) subject to a hard holding constraint \(H_{\mathrm{rig}} \ge H_{\min}\). Shows that optimal operation sits on the critical surface \(H = H_{\min}\).  
  

More entries in this series (VII, XI, …) refine the connection between holding, flows, and effective dynamics.

## 4 · Holding and Morphogenesis

These works connect holding with **collapse, transition and form**.

- **Holding and Morphogenesis: Collapse–Transition Regimes and Synkyrian Companions**  
  Splits exits into destructive collapse versus morphogenetic transitions, defines distinct holding exponents for each regime, and sketches how a two-layer Companion (safety vs. morphogenesis) can act inside these dynamics.  
  

- **Holding as a Viability Functional – Bridging to Geometric Morphogenesis**  
  Technical bridges that support the “Synkyrian Geometric Morphogenesis” paper: how CRQ, SCP and transformation windows arise from hazard-weighted path integrals of the holding functional.  
  *(More detailed links to be added.)*

## 5 · Networks, Cheeger bounds and composition

These works underpin the Synkyrian Networked Fields note and the network layer of the programme.

- **XI – Cheeger-type Bounds for Synkyrian Network Holding**  

  [Page](/notes/hvf-xi/) · [PDF](/access/)

  Establishes Cheeger-type inequalities for the long-horizon holding exponent of killed Markov networks, linking asymptotic holding \(H_{\infty}\) to a Synkyrian Cheeger constant built from hazards and coupling weights.  
  

- **Network Composition, Coupling and Kernel Stability**  

  [Page](/notes/hvf-vii/) · [PDF](/access/)

  Analyses how network-level holding can be represented as a coupling factor times a sum of node-wise contributions, disentangling topology, interaction strength and local holding dynamics.  
  

- **Bridge Notes on Networked Fields**  
  Additional notes (e.g. on hazard-weighted cuts, shared-capacity measures and coupling operators) that connect the abstract Cheeger picture with concrete Synkyrian network applications.  
  *(Links to be added.)*

## 6 · Work in progress and additional notes

There are further technical pieces – including Tropic Physics (Vol.30), extended TEE systems, and bridges to open-system thermodynamics and cosmology – which are being consolidated.

As these stabilise and are released on Zenodo or similar platforms, they will be added here with links and short descriptions.

For now, this page should be read as a **map**, not as a complete catalogue.
